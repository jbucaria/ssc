# Seven Springs CrossFit App Development Checklist

## Phase 1: Requirements, Planning & Design

1. **Define Project Scope & Features:**

   - List all core functionalities:
     - Class scheduling (calendar, reminders, push notifications)
     - Workout posting and tracking (with dynamic timer features: count up, count down, intervals)
     - Chat (one-on-one, group, plus manager push notifications)
     - Leaderboard based on workout scores
     - User roles (Manager, Coach, Athlete)
     - Store for products and merch presales (with payment and auto-payment integration)
   - Confirm the tech stack: Expo/React Native, Firebase, and Stripe.

2. **Wireframing & UI/UX Design:**

   - Create wireframes for key screens:
     - Login/Authentication
     - Dashboard/Home
     - Class Scheduling Calendar
     - Workout Posting/Tracking (with timer settings)
     - Chat Interface
     - Leaderboard
     - User Profile
     - Store/Products Page
   - Integrate existing branding and logo into the designs.
   - _Note:_ Wireframes can be drawn on paper, a whiteboard, or created digitally using tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD.

3. **Architectural Planning:**
   - Map out the overall system architecture:
     - How the frontend (Expo) will interact with Firebase for data, authentication, and real-time features.
     - How Stripe will be integrated for payments.
   - Design a preliminary database schema for Firebase to support your features.

## Phase 2: Environment Setup & Tooling

1. **Development Environment:**
   - Set up your local development environment.
   - Install necessary dependencies and libraries for Expo/React Native.
2. **Version Control & CI/CD:**

   - Initialize a Git repository and commit your initial project setup.
   - Configure a CI/CD pipeline (using GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or Travis CI) for automated testing and builds.

3. **Time Tracking Setup:**
   - Choose a time tracking tool (e.g., Toggl, Clockify, or Harvest) or set up a simple spreadsheet.
   - Set up categories or tags for different phases (planning, coding, testing, etc.) to monitor your progress and productivity.

---

## Phase 3: Backend Foundations

1. **User Authentication & Permissions:**

   - Implement Firebase authentication.
   - Set up role-based access control (Manager, Coach, Athlete) early on, as this affects most features.

2. **Database & API Structure:**

   - Create your Firebase database structure to support:
     - Scheduling data
     - Workout details
     - Chat messages
     - User profiles
   - Develop the core business logic and API endpoints for these functionalities.

3. **Push Notifications:**

   - Integrate basic push notification functionality (using Firebase Cloud Messaging) to allow managers to send alerts.

4. **Payment Processing:**
   - Set up Stripe in test mode.
   - Verify that the payment and auto-payment processes work correctly before integrating into the UI.

---

## Phase 4: Frontend Development (UI & Integration)

1. **UI Skeleton Build:**

   - Develop the basic UI screens using Expo based on your wireframes:
     - Login/Sign-up
     - Dashboard/Home
     - Class scheduling interface (calendar view)
     - Workout posting/tracking screens (including dynamic timer component)
     - Chat screens (supporting individual and group chats)
     - Leaderboard display
     - User profile page
     - Store and payment pages

2. **Integrate Backend Services:**

   - Connect UI components to Firebase for:
     - Authentication and user data.
     - Scheduling and workout data retrieval.
     - Real-time chat functionality.
   - Integrate the Stripe payment system into the store UI.

3. **Iterative UI Improvements:**
   - Refine the UI/UX based on initial integration testing and user feedback.

---

## Phase 5: Testing & Module Integration

1. **Unit Testing:**

   - Write tests for individual components (e.g., authentication flows, timer functionality, scheduling logic).

2. **Integration Testing:**

   - Ensure that connected modules (UI components with backend services) work seamlessly together.

3. **End-to-End Testing:**

   - Simulate complete user flows (from sign-up to scheduling, workout logging, chat, and payment processing).

4. **Beta Testing:**
   - Roll out a beta version (using TestFlight for iOS or Google Play Beta for Android) to a small group for real-world feedback.
   - Use this feedback to refine both UI and backend functionalities.

---

## Phase 6: Final Preparations & Launch

1. **Finalize CI/CD Pipeline:**

   - Confirm that your continuous integration system is running tests and building the app with every commit.

2. **Polish UI/UX:**

   - Make final adjustments to the design, ensuring consistency and responsiveness across platforms.

3. **Deployment:**

   - Deploy your app using Expo for iOS, Android, and any other target platforms.
   - Set up monitoring with analytics and error tracking to catch any post-launch issues.

4. **Post-Launch Iteration:**
   - Collect user feedback.
   - Plan and implement incremental updates for improvements and new features.
